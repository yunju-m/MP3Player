I could've sworn it was a dream
When I kissed your lips and fell (uh)
Saw a different side of me (ah)
It's like I didn't hate myself
At first, I thought that he was just a friend
But then I heard that you were loving him
You broke my heart and I don't really think that you mind
Oh, you build me up and turn me on
You play me like your favorite song
But I guess that you were never really mine (oh)
You made me feel like I was yours, you made me feel so insecure
But I guess that you were never really mine
Woo
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
So crossed my heart and hope to die
Never date a girl like you
After all the shit you put me through
Yeah, all you ever did was lie
Pants on fire, pants on fire
Guess you can't find love in Mollywood
No you can't find love when you're searching for better
Hope you find something better, either way it's whatever
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, oh yeah
Oh, you build me up and turn me on
You played me like your favorite song
But I guess that you were never really mine (oh)
You made me feel like I was yours, you made me feel so insecure
But I guess that you were never really mine
Woo
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
You made me feel like I was yours, you made me feel so insecure
But I guess that you were never really mine
