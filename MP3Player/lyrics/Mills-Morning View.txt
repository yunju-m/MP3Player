I wanna take you dancing girl in Paris girl
More fancy than your parents were
Pick out your favorite wine
I thought we'd eat a lot at 4 to 5
You're hella good in Hollywood
Show you all the things
That our bodies could do
She whispered in my ear I like this
I like this morning view
She woke up next to me
So I don't have a text to read
OJ champagne sunshine ecstasy yeah
We're pillow talkin' 'fore you're walkin'
She pointing at my phone
But I don't care who's callin'
Press decline 'cause she gonna be mine
While I have her
Miss the mind of the things don't matter
I'm the one that gets you high as a ladder
Kiss your thighs you call me king of flatter
I wanna take you dancing girl in Paris girl
More fancy than your parents were
Pick out your favorite wine
I thought we'd eat a lot at 4 to 5
You're hella good in Hollywood
Show you all the things
That our bodies could do
She whispered in my ear I like this
I like this morning view
I found myself running away
From growing up fast
But you make me feel young I hope this lasts
Longer than the weekend
You ask me questions like
Who I've been singing about
And right now it's you
You like the ＿ so I sing at you
End of the night let's go back to the room
Hit the moon right now ＿
I wanna take you dancing girl in Paris girl
More fancy than your parents were
Pick out your favorite wine
I thought we'd eat a lot at 4 to 5
You're hella good in Hollywood
Show you all the things
That our bodies could do
She whispered in my ear I like this
I like this morning view
I like this
She said to me I like this
I like this morning view
