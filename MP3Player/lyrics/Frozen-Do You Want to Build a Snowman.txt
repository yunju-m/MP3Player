Elsa?
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Come on let's go and play
I never see you any more
Come out the door
It's like you've gone away!
We used to be best buddies
And now we're not
I wish you would tell me why
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
(Go away, Anna!)
Okay, bye
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Or ride our bike around the halls?
I think some company is overdue
I've started talking to the pictures on the walls!
Hang in there, Joan!
It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms
Just watching the hours tick by
Elsa?
Please, I know you're in there
People are asking where you've been
They say, "Have courage", and I'm trying to
I'm right out here for you
Just let me in
We only have each other
It's just you and me
What are we gonna do?
Do you wanna build a snowman?
