Written in stone
Every rule, every word
Centuries old and unbending
Stay in your place
Better seen and not heard
Well now that story is ending
Cause I
I cannot start to crumble
So come on and try
Try to shut me and cut me down
I won't be silenced
You can't keep me quiet
Won't tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless
Speechless
Let the storm in
I cannot be broken
No, I won't live unspoken
Cause I know that I won't go speechless
Try to lock me in this cage
I won't just lay me down and die
I will take these broken wings
And watch me burn across the sky
And it echoes saying I...
Won't be silenced
Though you wanna see me tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless
Speechless
Cause I'll breathe
When they try to suffocate me
Don't you underestimate me
Cause I know that I won't go speechless
All I know is I won't go speechless
Speechless
