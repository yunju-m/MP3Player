I don't wanna write another sad song
I don't wanna cry about some guy who didn't care enough
I really thought that this would be more fun
Why's it gotta be so fucking hard to fall in love?
Calling up my friends, I ask what's wrong with me?
They always give the same damn look and say the same thing
"Jordy, promise that someday you'll find the one"
Then why's it gotta be so fucking hard to fall in love?
They always say it's them and not me
So why's it gotta hurt when they leave?
I just wanna
I just wanna be
I just wanna
I just wanna be loved
I just wanna be loved, loved, loved, loved
I just wanna
I just wanna be
I just wanna
I just wanna be loved
I just really wanna be loved, loved, loved, loved
Gettin' kinda used to the attention
But then you had to go and throw me right into the friendzone, wait, no
Can't they find someone who wants me more?
Is it too much just to ask to be adored?
Why I always go ahead and choose
The ones who got commitment issues?
(Damn)
I just wanna
I just wanna be
I just wanna
I just wanna be loved
I just wanna be loved, loved, loved, loved
I just wanna
I just wanna be
I just wanna
I just wanna be loved
I just really wanna be loved, loved, loved, loved
Oh, we all just wanna be loved
(Oh, we just, just wanna be)
Oh, we all just wanna be loved
(I just wanna be)
Waitin' for the one can be exhausting
And I know if I keep looking, he'll never come knocking
Just me wondering when I will be enough
To make another person look at me and fall in love (uh)
I just wanna
I just wanna be
I just wanna
I just wanna be loved (I wanna be loved, I wanna be loved, oh, oh)
I just wanna be loved, loved, loved, loved
I just wanna (I just wanna be)
I just wanna be
I just wanna (I just wanna be loved)
I just wanna be loved (oh)
I just really wanna be loved, loved, loved, loved (oh, oh)
Oh, we all just wanna be loved, loved, loved, loved
