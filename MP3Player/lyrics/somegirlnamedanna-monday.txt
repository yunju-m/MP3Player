I got a boy on the West Coast
We're so close but he doesn't know
That I don't like him that much, yeah
And tonight I would end it if he didn't just get a
Ticket for both of us to Coachella next month, mm-mm
If I'm being honest I know that he's not the one
And I feel kinda bad that I keep stringing him along
So I'll do it on Monday
Better yet, let's wait for Tuesday (Tuesday)
'Cause we might make out on Wednesday
And then Thursday turns to Friday
And who the hell wants to be at home all alone on the weekend?
So I'll guess I'll wait for Monday, yeah
Yeah, I guess I'll wait for Monday, yeah
I like to drink red wine, get high
I wanna have a good time when I go out with my friends, yeah
Took a semester off, probably should find a job
Given the cost to ball 'cross the world
I wanna buy a new Benz
Ride it with all of my friends
And if I'm being honest I know that he's not the one (The one)
And I feel kinda bad that I keep stringing him along
So I'll do it on Monday
Better yet, let's wait for Tuesday, Tuesday
'Cause we might make out on Wednesday
And then Thursday turns to Friday
And who the hell wants to be at home all alone on the weekend?
So I'll guess I'll wait for Monday
Better yet, let's wait for Tuesday
'Cause we might make out on Wednesday
And then Thursday turns to Friday
And who the hell wants to be at home all alone on the weekend?
So I'll guess I'll wait for Monday (I
Guess I'll wait, I guess I'll wait), yeah
Yeah, I guess I'll wait for Monday (I
Guess I'll wait, I guess I'll wait), yeah
Yeah, I guess I'll wait for Monday (I
Guess I'll wait, I guess I'll wait), yeah
I guess I'll wait for Monday (I
Guess I'll wait, I guess I'll wait), yeah
